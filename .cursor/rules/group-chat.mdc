We'll introduce a Supervisor Agent. It will decide who to send message in the group chat (or just stop, asking user to engage in)

For example, if a group has these members:

- Human (user)
- Designer
- Developer
- Product Manager

When user say: "How to build a todo app?":

1. Supervisor Agent will decide who to start thinking, he think we should start with the PM
2. PM got all context and generate a response. Now provide the new full history to the supervisor agent
3. Supervisor Agent decide Designer should start thinking
4. Designer got all context and generate a response. Now provide the new full history to the supervisor agent
5. Supervisor Agent decide waiting for human to respond
